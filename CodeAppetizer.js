// Class Exercise

// Exercise taken from Stoyan Stefanov's 'Onject Oriented Javascript' book 
// 1. Create an object called 'shape' that has a 'type' property and a 'getType' method. 
// 2. Define a Triangle constructor function whose prototype is shape. Objects created with Triangle should have three own properties: a, b, c representing the sides of a triangle. 
// 3. Add a new method to the prototype called getPerimeter.


function makePasswd(passwordLength){
	var password= '';
	var chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789';
	for (i=0; i < passwordLength, i++) {
	}
	 return (passwordLength)};
